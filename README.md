# Recommendation Analysis

## Description
The goal of this project is to perform a recommendation analysis on a dataset of women's clothing reviews. The objective will be to model whether a particular piece of clothing is recommended or not based on the reviews it has received.
In order to do so, severall models are trained and evaluated. All the job is done and explained in the notebook Trabajo_texto.ipynb.


## Installation
Creating a new virtual environment is highly recommended.

Python 3.11 is a must.

For installing the packages just run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
Just run the the notebook after installing all the packages. The two last models could take a couple of minutes.

With the aim of having a good time and trying something new I tried to develop a Streamlit app to predict reviews entered by the user.


Note: The Streamlit application was not intended as part of the practice. I simply wanted to try out the library and decided to leave it here, but it should not be evaluated as part of the assignment.


Just run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run .\Streamlit.py
```
