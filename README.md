# Recommendation Analysis

## Description
The goal of this project is to perform a recommendation analysis on a dataset of women's clothing reviews. The objective will be to model whether a particular piece of clothing is recommended or not based on the reviews it has received.
In order to do so, severall models are trained and evaluated. All the job is done and explained in the notebook Trabajo_texto.ipynb.


## Installation
Creating a new virtual environment is highly recommended.

Python 3.11 is a must.

For installing the packages just run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
Just run the the notebook after installing all the packages. The two last models could take a couple of minutes.

With the aim of having a good time and getting a glimpse of possible real-world applications, there is a Streamlit app to predict reviews entered by the user. 
Just run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run .\Streamlit.py
```
